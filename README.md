# Create New Project File

This repository provides Python scripts for creating project folders with predefined subfolders, designed to better organize and manage projects. Using these tools, you can easily setup working project directory structures automatically. Two scripts have been created: one you can run from a command line, and the other using a GUI.

## Command Line Script

The `create_new_project_file.py` script is a command line interface tool for creating new project folders. It prompts the user to enter project details and choose a location for the new project folder. It then creates the specified folder structure.

## GUI Script

The `create_new_project_file_gui.py` script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using PySimpleGUI. It allows users to interactively enter project details, choose a location for the new project folder, and select main folders to create. This script can easily create project folders with a more user-friendly experience.
